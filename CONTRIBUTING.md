## Development Process

### Setting Up Development Environment

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ecommerce-pipeline.git
   cd ecommerce-pipeline
   ```
3. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
4. Install development dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```
5. Set up pre-commit hooks:
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

### Development Workflow

1. Create a new branch for your changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
   
2. Make your changes and ensure they follow our coding standards

3. Write or update tests for your changes

4. Run tests to ensure they pass:
   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

5. Run linting to ensure code quality:
   ```bash
   flake8
   black .
   isort .
   ```

6. Commit your changes with a descriptive commit message:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add feature: your feature description"
   ```

7. Push your branch to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

8. Submit a pull request to the main repository

### Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md or documentation with details of changes if appropriate
2. Update the CHANGELOG.md with details of changes
3. The PR should work on the main branch and pass all automated tests
4. A maintainer will review your PR and may request changes
5. Once approved, a maintainer will merge your PR

## Coding Standards

### Python Code Style

- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide
- Use [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) for code formatting
- Use [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/) for import sorting
- Use [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/) for linting

### Documentation

- Use docstrings for all modules, classes, and functions
- Follow [Google Python Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) for docstrings
- Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes

### Testing

- Write unit tests for all new functionality
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting a PR
- Aim for high test coverage

## Component-Specific Guidelines

### Data Generation

- Ensure generated data is realistic and follows the expected schema
- Include appropriate randomization to simulate real-world scenarios
- Document all data generation parameters

### Data Ingestion

- Handle errors gracefully with appropriate logging
- Validate input data against schemas
- Support both batch and streaming ingestion patterns

### Data Processing

- Optimize Spark transformations for performance
- Document all transformation logic clearly
- Handle edge cases and null values appropriately

### Data Validation

- Create comprehensive validation suites for all data layers
- Document validation rules and thresholds
- Ensure validation is efficient for large datasets

### Orchestration

- Design DAGs and flows with clear dependencies
- Include appropriate error handling and retries
- Document orchestration workflows

### Monitoring

- Implement appropriate logging at all levels
- Create meaningful alerts with actionable information
- Design dashboards for clear visibility into pipeline health

## Release Process

1. Update version number in relevant files
2. Update CHANGELOG.md with all notable changes
3. Create a new GitHub release with appropriate tag
4. Publish release notes
